      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Cedric Vallieu, I am a Software Developer based out of Seattle, WA. I lead support at DevHub - a 14 year old high growth software as a service company here in Belltown. I have a background in Sales, Customer Services, And Administration. My role is to work directly under the CTO supporting over 200+ brands that white label our technology to scale their sites, landing pages, and proxies development for other brands as an agency or partner or to build out for themselves internally. Whenever there is a bug or an error with any of those pages or sites my role within DevHub as Head support is to fix them and get them back online as quick as possible maintaining our SLA - Service level agreements with these enterprise clients, If the issue becomes too complicated for me to handle then I would pass it to another developer on my team to assist. The purpose of me taking Code Fellows is to tighten up my software development skills for my leadership role at work. My previous experiences push me to be more understanding, self motivated, and an effective communicator to organize and rally individuals or a team towards the completion of a common goal, with brutal honesty, grounded self reflection, and imagination useful for creative problem solving.  I am inspired by the desire to strive for personal greatness, and continually provide my family with an abundant and happy life.   Thank you ðŸ’œ",
